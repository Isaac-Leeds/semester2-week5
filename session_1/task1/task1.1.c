/*
 * Task 1.1
 *
 * Write a C program that checks whether a user has sufficient account 
 * balance to complete a purchase. The program should compare the account 
 * balance with the purchase amount and determine if the transaction can be completed.
 * 
 * Input
 * - account balance: a floating-point number
 * - purchase amount: a floating-point number
 * 
 * Output
 * - Print "Transaction Approved. Remaining balance xx.xx" if the balance is greater 
 *   than or equal to the purchase amount
 * - Otherwise, print "Insufficient Balance"
